# Lan Flower Sketch 
Lan Flower Sketch is one of my creative work to use pure math and shader knowledge to draw the orchard flowers in ancient chinese painting style. 

You can preview the effect on

The effect is written by using tools like [canvas-sketch](https://github.com/mattdesl/canvas-sketch), [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), and glsl. All original js files are in `src` folder. 
If you download the `src` folder, use commonds to preview the effect: 

`canvas-sketch index.js --open`
